# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview

This project segments customers based on purchasing behavior using clustering techniques. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups that can be targeted for marketing or product recommendations.

## Data

The data consists of transactional records, including customer IDs, products purchased, and the total purchase amount.

## Methodology

We processed the data by cleaning and aggregating transactional details at the customer level. Using **KMeans** clustering, we identified distinct customer segments.

## Results

Three primary customer segments were identified:

1. **Low Spend, Frequent Buyers**: Customers who make frequent small purchases.
2. **High Spend, Infrequent Buyers**: Customers who make large but infrequent purchases.
3. **Mid Spend, Moderate Buyers**: Customers who fall between the extremes.

These insights can guide targeted marketing strategies.

## Power BI Dashboard

A Power BI dashboard has been created to visualize the segmentation results.
