# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview

This project applies clustering techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. We utilize Python for data preprocessing and clustering, PostgreSQL for storing customer data, and Streamlit for a web-based dashboard. A Power BI dashboard is provided for additional visualization.

## Technologies

- **Python**: Data cleaning, clustering (KMeans, PCA).
- **Streamlit**: Dashboard for interactive visualization.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database to store customer segmentation results.
- **Power BI**: Data visualization dashboard.
